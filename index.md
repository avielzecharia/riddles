This page contains a collection of exciting (it's all relative 🤓) riddles of different levels from various fields (Math & CS). 
The specific field/level of each riddle does not mentioned on purpose - **That's why it's fun**.

## Tips & Tricks 💡
- Try to reduce the riddle to the primitive case, then exapnd your solution
  - e.g. given a large parameter, starts with the minimal possible one instead of the original
  - Solve it like a dumbass, trying to find the rules
- Reframe the problem with a workable mathematical model
  - e.g. functiosn, points, graphs, etc.
- Start with the trivial algorithm, then understand why is it so wastful
- You are lost
  - Understand why all existing tricks does not work here, what have been changed?
  - Search for related topics on internet
  - Sleep & Shower & Drive with this riddle in your head
  - DO NOT GIVE UP !
- After solving the riddle (👌), try to exapnd your solution to the general case
  - e.g. changing parameters, cancel existing assumptions, ask more interesting questions
- Each riddle teaches you a certain method of action that is repeated in many other places
  - understand the big picture, and think how this trick can be reused
  - e.g. XOR operation

# "Let there be light", God. 🔦
In Israel, two cities are called "friends" if they have a common underground electricity infrastructure.
Each city has a button, which flips the lighting state in the city - due to infrastructure issues, this also changes "friends" state.
During the day, all lights are turned off in Israel.

- Night is coming, is it possible to turn on the light in Israel?
- If you do, describe how can you do that (efficiently?)
- If you do, how many possible ways there are to light Israel up?


# Are you in? 🫱🏾‍🫲🏾
You are given a polygon in Euclidean space, and a location which describes you.

- How can you tell if you are inside or outside the polygon?


# Round Table 🪙
Alice and Bob playing a game. In each turn the player must put a 1₪ coin on a round table. 
The first who has no left space to put the coin - loses.

- Alice may choose to whether start or not (ladies first), can she always win?
- If she do, describe Alice strategy


# MinDiv 🔢
We define the MinDiv of number n to be the minimal number which is divided by all number from 1 to n.

- Give a formula for DivMin(n)
- How can you calculate MinDiv efficiently?


# Gen-Y 👩🏽‍👦🏾
You are given two linked lists in ROM.

- How can you determine if they merged?
- Describe a way to find the merge point


# Nightmare 🌃
Calculate the exact value of the following expression:

$$\int_{0}^{\pi/2} ln(4-sin^2(x)) dx$$


# Drunk Fly 🪰
Two subway trains of distance $S$ are moving toward each other at constant speed. 
A poor fly got stuck between them and flew back and forth at constant speed.

- What is the distance the fly will travel until it crashes?


# 50-50 🌓
Let S be a group of numbers of size 2n+1.
It is given that every subset of size 2n can be divided into two groups of equal size and sum.

- Prove that all S members are equal


# Building Pyramids 📐
You are given a set of balls divided into random number of piles.
At each step, a ball is taken from each pile and a new pile of balls is created from them (empty piles are ignored).

$$number of balls = T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$
```
OOO, OOO  ->  OO, OO, OO  ->  OOO, O, O, O  ->  OOOO, OO  ->  OOO, OO, O  ->  OOO, OO, O  ->  ... [Pyramid] ...
```

-Prove that after finite number of steps we will reach the "Pyramid" stable state.


# Binary Gold 🥇
Alice and Bob play a game for 100 gold coins.
In each turn, every player must take a number of coins that is a power of 2.
The last one to take coins - wins.

- Alice may choose to whether start or not (ladies first), can she always win?
- If she do, describe Alice strategy
