This page contains a collection of exciting (it's all relative ðŸ¤“) riddles of different levels from various fields (Math & CS). 
The specific field/level of each riddle does not mentioned on purpose - **That's why it's fun**.

Tips & Tricks
- Try to reduce the riddle to the primitive case, then exapnd your solution
  - e.g. given a large parameter, starts with the minimal possible one instead of the original
  - Solve it like a dumbass, trying to find the rules
- Reframe the problem with a workable mathematical model
  - e.g. functiosn, points, graphs, etc.
- Start with the trivial algorithm, then understand why is it so wastful
- You are lost
  - Understand why all existing tricks does not work here, what have been changed ?
  - Search for related topics on internet
  - Sleep & Shower & Drive with this riddle in your head
  - DO NOT GIVE UP !
- After solving the riddle (ðŸ‘Œ), try to exapnd your solution to the general case
  - e.g. changing parameters, cancel existing assumptions, ask more interesting questions
- Each riddle teaches you a certain method of action that is repeated in many other places
  - understand the big picture, and think how this trick can be reused
  - e.g. XOR operation

# "Let there be light", God.
In Israel, two cities are called "friends" if they have a common underground electricity infrastructure.
Each city has a button, which flips the lighting state in the city - due to infrastructure issues, this also changes "friends" state.
During the day, all lights are turned off in Israel.

- Night is coming, is it possible to turn on the light in Israel?
- If you do, describe how can you do that (efficiently?)
- If you do, how many possible ways there are to light Israel up?
